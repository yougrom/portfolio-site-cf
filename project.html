        <p>Welcome to the myFlix Movie App Project</p>
        <p>MyFlix Movie App is a sophisticated web application crafted with the MERN stack and Angular CLI. It is
          designed to provide movie enthusiasts with an immersive single-page application (SPA) experience. It features
          a vast database of movies, enabling users to explore detailed information, bookmark their favourites, and
          manage personal profiles. The application prioritizes user security by implementing JWT for authentication and
          employing robust password hashing mechanisms.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This project aimed to construct a fully functional web application, integrating server-side and client-side
            development from the ground up. This project enhances a professional portfolio by showcasing a high level of
            proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development.</p>

          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The primary purpose of the MyFlix Movie App is to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack JavaScript
            development as part of a web development course at CareerFoundry. This project showcases the integration of
            modern web technologies to create a secure, user-friendly platform for exploring and managing movie
            information.</p>

          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>For the server side, I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express and a non-relational database
            (MongoDB). The API allows data about movies and users to be retrieved from the database through common HTTP
            requests, which return JSON. The API and database are connected through a business logic layer using
            Mongoose.</p>

        <section class="content-block">
          <h3>Authentication</h3>
          <p>I also implemented a login endpoint with basic HTTP authentication, returning an authorization JWT (token)
            to the client. This ensures that only logged-in users can access the database. Initially, the mechanisms of
            authentication and authorization were quite challenging for me. However, after some time and effort, they
            became clear and functional. I used Postman to test the endpoints.</p>

        <section class="content-block">
          <h3>Business Logic</h3>
          <p>Utilizing CRUD operations, the API delivers movie information in JSON format, serving as the robust backend
            for the MyFlix Movie App. This enables comprehensive interaction with movie, director, and genre data,
            ensuring data is consistently formatted and easily accessible.</p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>The API is designed following REST principles, providing intuitive URLs, responses in JSON format, and
            standard HTTP status codes. It includes user registration and management functionalities features, as well
            as implementing JWT for secure authentication and password hashing for enhanced data protection.</p>

          <h3>Deployment</h3>
          <p>I've successfully connected my Heroku application to my MongoDB Atlas database by updating the connection
            URI in the "index.js" file with environment variables, pushed the changes to Heroku, and confirmed the app
            loads and connects to my database.</p>

          <p>Users can view their registered details, update their profile information, and manage their list of
            favourite movies.</p>

          <p>New users can create an account with a username, email, and password. Registered users can log in with
            their credentials. Passwords are securely hashed and JWT is used for secure sessions.</p>

          <h3>Retrospective</h3>
          <p>Developing the MyFlix Movie App was an engaging experience, especially building the RESTful API and setting
            up the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The biggest challenge was integrating all the components
            efficiently and ensuring seamless communication between the front and back. In the future, I plan to expand
            the MyFlix Movie App by incorporating additional features like advanced search and filtering options and
            personalized recommendations. I also aim to enhance the UI/UX by adding intuitive navigation and better
            accessibility features.</p>
